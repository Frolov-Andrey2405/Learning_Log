# Learning_Log

While learning new material, it can be useful to keep a log 📓 of what you have learned 🤔 - notes 📝 useful for controlling and returning to the necessary information. A good app makes this process 📈 more efficient.

It is a web application called Learning Log that allows the user to keep a log of topics of interest and create journal entries while studying each topic.  The Learning Log home page contains a description of the site and invites the user to register or enter 🔑 their credentials 🔒. After a successful login 🔓 the user is able to create new topics, add new entries, read and edit existing entries.

During the development 🔧 of the project, the Django administrative system was used to enter some initial data. Subsequently, the templates were used to build the Django pages on the basis of which Django will build the site.
